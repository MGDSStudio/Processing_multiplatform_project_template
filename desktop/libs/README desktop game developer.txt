This dir contains all the libraries we need for desktop specific purposes.
Some of these libs are OS and hardware specific. You can delete libs with names: Linux if you works on Windows.
Do not delete core.jar and jogl-all.jar but you can replace these libs with the newest. They are placed in your processing subdirectories.

If you want another libs for android purposes add it here or implement in the build.gradle file int this module (desktop) like: implementation 'org.firma.videogame.engine:data:X.X.X'
